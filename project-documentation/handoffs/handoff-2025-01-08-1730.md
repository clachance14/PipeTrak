# PipeTrak Development Session Handoff

**Generated**: January 8, 2025 at 5:30 PM  
**Session Duration**: Full Phase 1 implementation  
**Developer**: Claude Code  
**Project**: PipeTrak - Industrial Pipe Tracking System

## Session Summary

### Major Accomplishments
✅ **Completed Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture**
- All 8 Phase 1 tasks completed and verified
- Database schema designed with 7 PipeTrak-specific tables
- Authentication system configured with better-auth
- Project structure created with proper module organization
- Comprehensive documentation framework established
- Development scripts and tooling configured
- Full verification completed with passing status

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **Database**: Using Supabase cloud (not local Docker) for simpler setup
2. **Workflow Types**: Implemented three types (discrete, percentage, quantity) for flexibility
3. **Auth Strategy**: Leveraging existing better-auth with organization multi-tenancy
4. **Import Strategy**: User will provide Excel files; created scaffold for import logic
5. **UI Components**: Built Excel-like DataTable as core interaction pattern

### Problems Solved
- Fixed AuditLog relation error in Prisma schema
- Corrected all TypeScript import paths to use proper aliases
- Removed errant "2" package from dependencies
- Fixed TabGroup component props (tabs → items)
- Added missing @pipetrak TypeScript path alias

## Current Project State

### Phase Status
- **Phase 1**: ✅ COMPLETE (Foundation & Architecture)
- **Phase 2**: ⏳ READY TO START (Database & API Implementation)
- **Overall Progress**: 20% of MVP complete (1 of 5 phases)

### Development Environment
- **Node.js**: v24.3.0 ✅
- **pnpm**: 9.3.0 ✅
- **Next.js**: 15.3.5 with Turbopack ✅
- **Database**: Supabase cloud connection configured ✅
- **Dev Server**: Starts successfully on port 3000/3001 ✅

### Known Issues/Limitations
1. **Expected TypeScript Errors**: 20 errors for Phase 2 placeholder components (not yet implemented)
2. **No Seed Data**: As requested, will come from user's Excel files
3. **No Local Supabase**: Using cloud instance directly

## Critical Files Reference

### Priority 1 - Essential Context
1. **`CLAUDE.md`** - Project guidelines, tech stack, conventions, auth & database setup
2. **`project-documentation/prd.md`** - Complete product requirements and specifications
3. **`project-documentation/phase1-verification.md`** - Current state and verification results

### Priority 2 - Technical Architecture
4. **`project-documentation/architecture-output.md`** - Database schema, API contracts, implementation guide
5. **`packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma`** - Actual database models with PipeTrak tables
6. **`project-documentation/build-plan.md`** - 5-phase roadmap with current status

### Priority 3 - Implementation Reference
7. **`apps/web/modules/pipetrak/types.ts`** - TypeScript definitions for all entities
8. **`apps/web/modules/pipetrak/shared/components/DataTable.tsx`** - Core table component
9. **`project-documentation/agent-usage-playbook.md`** - Which agents to use for each task

### Recently Modified Files
- `.claude/commands/handoff.md` - This handoff command (just created)
- All files in `apps/web/modules/pipetrak/` - New PipeTrak module structure
- All files in `apps/web/app/(saas)/app/pipetrak/` - New route pages

## Quick Start Guide

```bash
# 1. Environment Verification
node --version  # Should show v24.3.0 or higher
pnpm --version  # Should show 9.3.0

# 2. Navigate to Project
cd /home/clachance14/projects/PipeTrak

# 3. Install Dependencies
pnpm install

# 4. Database Setup
pnpm db:generate  # Generate Prisma client with PipeTrak schema
pnpm db:push     # Push schema to Supabase (if needed)

# 5. Start Development Server
pnpm dev         # Starts on http://localhost:3000

# 6. Access PipeTrak
# Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/app/pipetrak

# 7. Database Management
pnpm db:studio   # Open Prisma Studio for database inspection

# 8. Import Excel Data (when ready)
pnpm --filter scripts import:excel <path-to-excel>
```

## Next Steps - Phase 2: Database & API Implementation

### Immediate Tasks (from build-plan.md)
1. **Create Database Migrations**
   - Apply Prisma schema to Supabase
   - Create initial migration files
   - Test rollback procedures

2. **Implement RLS Policies**
   - Organization-based data isolation
   - Project-level access control
   - User role enforcement

3. **Build API Endpoints**
   - Component CRUD operations
   - Milestone management
   - Import job processing

### Suggested Agent Usage
```bash
# For database migration and RLS:
Use pipetrak-backend-engineer agent with prompt:
"Create and apply database migrations for the PipeTrak schema. Implement RLS policies for organization-based multi-tenancy following the architecture-output.md specifications."

# For API implementation:
Use pipetrak-backend-engineer agent with prompt:
"Implement Hono RPC endpoints for Component CRUD operations including list, get, create, update, and bulk operations. Follow the API contracts in architecture-output.md."

# For testing:
Use pipetrak-qa-automation agent with prompt:
"Create pgTAP tests for the Component and Milestone database functions, ensuring RLS policies work correctly."
```

## Context Restoration Prompt

```
I'm resuming work on PipeTrak, an industrial pipe tracking system built with Next.js, Supabase, and Supastarter.

Current Status:
- Phase 1 (Foundation) is COMPLETE with all 8 tasks verified
- Database schema designed with 7 tables supporting 3 workflow types
- Project structure created at apps/web/modules/pipetrak/
- Ready to begin Phase 2: Database & API Implementation

Next Steps:
1. Create and apply database migrations
2. Implement RLS policies for security
3. Build API endpoints for Component CRUD

Please read:
1. CLAUDE.md for project guidelines and setup
2. project-documentation/phase1-verification.md for detailed status
3. project-documentation/build-plan.md for Phase 2 tasks
4. project-documentation/architecture-output.md for technical specifications

The codebase is at /home/clachance14/projects/PipeTrak
```

## Notes

### Git Status
- **Modified Files**: 8 files with configuration updates
- **Untracked Files**: All new PipeTrak modules and documentation
- **Recommendation**: Consider committing Phase 1 completion before starting Phase 2

### Important Reminders
1. Seed data will come from user's Excel files - import scaffold ready
2. Using Supabase cloud, not local Docker
3. Authentication is fully configured - no changes needed
4. TypeScript errors for missing Phase 2 components are expected

### Session Highlights
- Successfully adapted Supastarter template for industrial use case
- Created comprehensive documentation suite
- Established clear separation between phases
- Built foundation for Excel-like user experience
