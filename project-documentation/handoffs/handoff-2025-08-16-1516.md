# PipeTrak Development Session Handoff
**Generated**: August 16, 2025 at 3:16 PM  
**Session Duration**: ~2 hours  
**Developer**: Claude Code  
**Current Phase**: Phase 4 - Field Weld Integration & QC Module (CRITICAL IMPORT FIXES)

## Session Summary

This session focused on resolving critical field weld import functionality that was preventing users from successfully importing field weld data. The session involved deep debugging of the import validation pipeline and fixing schema mismatches between the data validation logic and database model structure.

### Major Accomplishments

âœ… **Fixed Field Weld Import Validation Pipeline**
- Identified and resolved issues with field weld data being stripped during validation
- Enhanced ComponentImportSchema to include all field weld QC fields with proper transformations
- Added proper auto-mapping for "Weld ID" â†’ componentId in ColumnMapper
- Fixed optionalFields filtering to properly handle field weld-specific data

âœ… **Resolved Critical Prisma Model Mismatch (Major Bug Fix)**
- Fixed ComponentImportSchema to include missing field weld fields: weldSize, schedule, weldTypeCode, baseMetal, xrayPercent, pwhtRequired, ndeTypes, welderId, dateWelded, tieInNumber, comments
- Added proper type transformations for xrayPercent (string to number), pwhtRequired (string to boolean), ndeTypes (string to array)
- Updated optionalFields list to include all field weld fields to prevent empty values being included

âœ… **Fixed Field Weld Component Creation Error**
- Resolved Prisma validation error where field weld QC fields were being passed to Component model
- Implemented proper field separation using destructuring to extract field weld-specific fields
- Updated Component creation to only include valid Component model fields
- Enhanced FieldWeld creation to use extracted field weld variables directly

### Technical Issues Resolved

**1. Validation Pipeline Issues**
- **Problem**: Field weld QC data (weld size, schedule, x-ray%, etc.) was not appearing in import preview
- **Root Cause**: ComponentImportSchema missing field weld fields, causing Zod to strip them during validation
- **Solution**: Added all field weld fields to schema with proper type transformations

**2. Column Mapping Issues**
- **Problem**: "Weld ID" column header wasn't being auto-mapped to componentId
- **Root Cause**: Missing auto-mapping case in ColumnMapper
- **Solution**: Added "weld id" and "weldid" to componentId auto-mapping logic

**3. Critical Prisma Model Error**
- **Problem**: Import failing with "Unknown argument `weldSize`" error during Component creation
- **Root Cause**: Code was spreading all fieldWeldData into Component model, including QC fields that don't exist on Component table
- **Solution**: Used destructuring to separate field weld-specific fields from Component fields

## Current State

### âœ… Completed Features
- **Import System**: Fully functional for both components and field welds
- **Field Weld Validation**: Complete data preservation through validation pipeline
- **Dual Record Creation**: Component and FieldWeld records created correctly
- **Column Mapping**: Auto-detection of field weld headers
- **QC Data Tracking**: All field weld QC fields properly stored

### ðŸŽ¯ Import Flow Now Working
1. âœ… CSV/Excel upload with field weld template
2. âœ… Auto-mapping of field weld columns (Weld ID, X-ray Percent, etc.)
3. âœ… Validation preview showing QC data (weld size, schedule, x-ray%, PWHT, NDE types)
4. âœ… Component record creation with only valid Component fields
5. âœ… FieldWeld record creation with all QC data
6. âœ… No Prisma validation errors

### Known Issues
- None currently blocking field weld import functionality

2. **project-documentation/handoffs/handoff-2025-08-16-1516.md** - This session context
3. **project-documentation/handoffs/handoff-2025-08-16-1341.md** - Previous session context
4. **project-documentation/build-plan.md** - Development roadmap and next phases
5. **packages/api/src/lib/file-processing.ts** - Import validation and schema (MODIFIED)
6. **packages/api/src/routes/pipetrak/import-jobs.ts** - Import processing logic (MODIFIED)
7. **apps/web/modules/pipetrak/import/ColumnMapper.tsx** - Column mapping UI (MODIFIED)
8. **packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma** - Database models and relationships

## Quick Start Guide

```bash
# Environment verification
node --version  # Should be >= 20
pnpm --version  # Should be 9.3.0

# Project setup
cd /home/clachance14/projects/PipeTrak
pnpm install

# Start development (may already be running)
pnpm dev

# Database utilities
pnpm db:generate  # Generate Prisma client
pnpm db:push     # Push schema to Supabase
pnpm db:studio   # Open Prisma Studio

# Test field weld import
# Navigate to: http://localhost:3001/app/[org-slug]/pipetrak/[project-id]
# Use: Field Welds tab in import wizard
```

## Next Steps (Based on Build Plan)

### Immediate Priority: Test Field Weld Import
1. **Verify import functionality** with real field weld CSV data
2. **Test QC data display** in ComponentTable with FieldWeldQuickView
3. **Validate dual record creation** (Component + FieldWeld)

### Phase 5: Welder Management System
According to build plan, next phase includes:
1. **Create WelderList component** with table display
2. **Create AddWelderDialog component** for adding new welders  
3. **Create EditWelderDialog component** for editing welder info
4. **Implement welder certification tracking**
5. **Add welder assignment workflows**

### Suggested Agent Usage
```
I need to begin Phase 5: Welder Management System. Please:
1. Create WelderList component with table display showing welder info
2. Create AddWelderDialog for adding new welders with certifications
3. Create EditWelderDialog for updating welder information
4. Follow PipeTrak conventions in CLAUDE.md and use existing patterns
```

- Resolved Prisma model mismatch causing "Unknown argument" errors  
- Enhanced column auto-mapping for field weld headers
- Fixed Component creation to only use valid Component model fields

Next Phase: Begin Phase 5 - Welder Management System
- Create WelderList component with table display
