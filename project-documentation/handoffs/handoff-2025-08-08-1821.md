## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Environment verification
node --version  # Should be >= 20
pnpm --version  # Should be 9.3.0

# Project setup
cd /home/clachance14/projects/PipeTrak
pnpm install

# Start development
pnpm dev

# Run tests
pnpm vitest --run           # Run all tests once
pnpm vitest                 # Run tests in watch mode
pnpm vitest ComponentTable  # Run specific test file

# Database utilities
pnpm --filter database generate  # Generate Prisma client
pnpm --filter database push      # Push schema to Supabase
pnpm --filter database studio    # Open Prisma Studio

```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks (Priority Order)

1. **Fix ComponentTable Test Failures**
   ```
   Focus on Select component interaction tests:
   - Update test selectors for SelectTrigger buttons
   - Fix "All Status" vs "All Statuses" text matching
   - Resolve pointer-events issues with Select components
   ```

2. **Mobile Card View Implementation**
   ```
   Use pipetrak-frontend-engineer agent:
   "Create a mobile card view transformation for the ComponentTable that:
   - Displays components as cards on screens < 768px
   - Shows key info (ID, status, progress) prominently
   - Maintains 52px touch targets for all interactive elements
   - Includes swipe gestures for status updates"
   ```

3. **Milestone Update Interface**
   ```
   Use pipetrak-frontend-engineer agent:
   "Build the milestone update interface that:
   - Uses card-based UI with '3 of 5 complete' patterns
   - Implements workflow-specific inputs (checkbox/percentage/quantity)
   - Shows visual milestone dependencies
   - Maintains 52px touch targets throughout"
   ```

4. **ISO Drawing Navigation Tree**
   ```
   Use pipetrak-frontend-engineer agent:
   "Implement the ISO drawing navigation that:
   - Shows hierarchical drawing structure (P-35F11 format)
   - Displays component counts per drawing
   - Includes search and filter capabilities
   - Highlights drawings with incomplete components"
   ```

### Current Blockers
- ComponentTable tests need Select component interaction fixes
- No major architectural blockers

### Dependencies
- All backend APIs ready and tested
- 81 SDO Tank components available for testing
- Authentication and organization system working
- Testing infrastructure established

## Restoration Prompt for Next Session

```

Current Status:
- Phase 3 (Core Features Implementation) is IN PROGRESS
- Testing infrastructure complete with 47 passing tests
- EnhancedDataTable and API actions fully tested
- ComponentTable has 10 failing tests that need fixing
- Import path issues have been resolved

Next immediate tasks:
1. Fix remaining ComponentTable test failures (Select interactions)
2. Create mobile card view transformation
3. Build milestone update interface with card-based UI
4. Implement ISO drawing navigation tree

Please read:
1. CLAUDE.md for project guidelines
2. project-documentation/handoffs/handoff-2025-08-08-1821.md for session context
3. project-documentation/product-manager-output.md for Phase 3 specifications
4. project-documentation/build-plan.md for remaining Phase 3 tasks

Focus on fixing the ComponentTable tests first, then proceed with mobile UI features.
```

## Notes

### Key Insights
1. **Import Path Consistency**: Always use `@shared/` not `@modules/shared/` for imports
2. **Test Coverage Growing**: 47 tests provide good foundation for quality assurance
3. **UI Testing Challenges**: Select components require special handling in tests
4. **Progress Tracking**: Testing phase nearly complete, ready for feature development

### Recommendations
1. Fix ComponentTable tests before adding new features
2. Consider adding integration tests for complete workflows
3. Document any new testing patterns discovered
4. Keep test coverage above 80% as features are added

### Technical Debt
1. 10 failing ComponentTable tests need resolution
2. Consider adding E2E tests with Playwright
3. Some test files could benefit from better organization

### Session Metrics
- **Tests Created**: 38 new tests (ComponentTable + API actions)
- **Tests Fixed**: 3 EnhancedDataTable tests
- **Files Modified**: 6 component/test files
- **Import Errors Fixed**: 4 files corrected
- **Total Test Coverage**: ~70% of Phase 3 components

### Documentation Updated
1. ✅ Created this handoff document
2. ✅ Previous session handoff remains accurate for Phase 3 initiation

Phase 3 testing infrastructure is substantially complete. The project is ready for continued feature development with a solid quality assurance foundation.
