## Overview

This document tracks known technical debt, performance issues, and improvement opportunities in the PipeTrak system. Items are categorized by priority and impact to production deployment.

**Definition**: Technical debt includes code quality issues, architectural shortcuts, performance bottlenecks, incomplete implementations, and missing non-functional requirements that need addressing for production readiness.

---

## 🔴 Priority 1: Production Blockers

These issues **must** be resolved before production deployment.

### 1.1 Import System Error Handling
- **Issue**: Validation messages too technical for end users
- **Impact**: Field users cannot understand import failures
- **Location**: `/apps/web/modules/pipetrak/import/ValidationPreview.tsx`
- **Example**: "Constraint violation: duplicate key" → Should be "This component already exists"
- **Effort**: 8-16 hours
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Target**: End of January 2025

### 1.2 Mobile Touch Target Standardization  
- **Issue**: Touch targets inconsistent across components, some below 48px
- **Impact**: Poor field usability on mobile devices
- **Location**: Multiple components in mobile interface
- **Examples**: 
  - Milestone checkboxes: 32px (need 48px)
  - Swipe action indicators: 40px (need 48px)
- **Effort**: 16-24 hours
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Target**: End of January 2025

### 1.3 Error Boundaries Implementation
- **Issue**: No graceful degradation when components fail
- **Impact**: Entire app can crash from single component error
- **Location**: Missing from React component tree
- **Solution**: Implement ErrorBoundary wrapper components
- **Effort**: 8-12 hours
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Target**: Early February 2025

### 1.4 Memory Management in Large Imports
- **Issue**: Large Excel files (1000+ rows) cause memory pressure
- **Impact**: Browser crashes or slow performance during import
- **Location**: `/packages/api/src/lib/import/excel-parser.ts`
- **Solution**: Streaming/chunked processing
- **Effort**: 16-24 hours
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Target**: Early February 2025

## 🟡 Priority 2: Performance & User Experience

These issues impact user experience but don't block production.

### 2.1 Loading State Consistency
- **Issue**: Inconsistent loading indicators across the application
- **Impact**: Users uncertain about system state
- **Location**: Multiple components lack proper loading states
- **Examples**:
  - Dashboard metrics loading: No skeleton
  - Import preview: Generic spinner instead of progress
  - Component table: No virtualization loading state
- **Effort**: 12-16 hours
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Target**: February 2025

### 2.2 Query Performance Optimization
- **Issue**: Some database queries not optimized for large datasets
- **Impact**: Slow response times with 10,000+ components
- **Location**: Dashboard RPC functions, component search
- **Examples**:
  - Component search: No indexed full-text search
  - Dashboard aggregations: Missing composite indexes
- **Effort**: 8-16 hours
- **Status**: Partially Addressed
- **Target**: March 2025

### 2.3 Keyboard Navigation Completion
- **Issue**: Partial keyboard navigation implementation
- **Impact**: Accessibility issues for keyboard-only users
- **Location**: DataTable, modal dialogs, milestone editors
- **Missing**: Tab order, escape handling, focus management
- **Effort**: 16-20 hours
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Target**: March 2025

### 2.4 Virtual Scrolling Edge Cases
- **Issue**: Virtual scrolling issues with rapid filtering/sorting
- **Impact**: UI glitches with large component tables
- **Location**: `EnhancedDataTable.tsx`
- **Examples**: Row heights inconsistent after filter changes
- **Effort**: 8-12 hours
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Target**: February 2025

## 🟢 Priority 3: Code Quality & Maintainability

These issues don't impact users but affect development velocity.

### 3.1 Test Coverage Gaps
- **Issue**: Some critical paths lack test coverage
- **Impact**: Risk of regressions, slower development confidence
- **Location**: Multiple areas
- **Coverage Gaps**:
  - Bulk update operations: 60% coverage
  - Import validation: 70% coverage
  - Mobile swipe gestures: 30% coverage
- **Effort**: 24-40 hours
- **Status**: Ongoing
- **Target**: Ongoing improvement

### 3.2 TypeScript Strict Mode
- **Issue**: Some files not using strict TypeScript settings
- **Impact**: Type safety gaps, potential runtime errors
- **Location**: Legacy components, some utility files
- **Solution**: Enable strict mode, fix type issues
- **Effort**: 16-24 hours
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Target**: March 2025

### 3.3 Component Props Documentation
- **Issue**: Complex components lack proper TypeDoc documentation
- **Impact**: Slower development, harder maintenance
- **Location**: Milestone system, DataTable, import wizard
- **Solution**: Add comprehensive TypeDoc comments
- **Effort**: 12-16 hours
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Target**: As needed

### 3.4 Code Duplication in Mobile Components
- **Issue**: Mobile and desktop components share similar logic
- **Impact**: Maintenance burden, inconsistent behavior
- **Location**: Mobile vs desktop component implementations
- **Solution**: Extract shared logic into hooks/utilities
- **Effort**: 16-24 hours
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Target**: Future refactoring

## 🔧 Resolution Strategies

### Immediate (January 2025)
1. **Focus on Priority 1 items only** - Production blockers first
2. **Parallel development** - Multiple developers on different debt items
3. **Quality gates** - No new features until Priority 1 resolved

### Short-term (February 2025)
1. **Address Priority 2 items** affecting user experience
2. **Implement monitoring** for performance metrics
3. **Establish debt prevention** practices

### Long-term (March+ 2025)
1. **Code quality improvements** for maintainability
2. **Technical debt sprint** each quarter
3. **Architectural improvements** for scalability
