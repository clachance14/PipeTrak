## Development Workflow

### Daily Standup Focus
1. **Import system**: Any blockers on error handling improvements?
2. **Mobile polish**: Touch target and swipe gesture progress?
3. **Testing**: Real device testing results?
4. **Blockers**: Any technical or UX issues blocking progress?

### Weekly Goals
- **Week 1**: Complete import error handling and basic mobile polish
- **Week 2**: Finish mobile optimization and begin audit trail
- **Week 3**: Complete audit trail and error handling systems
- **Week 4**: Performance optimization and testing

### Definition of Done
Each feature must meet:
- [ ] Functional requirements complete
- [ ] User testing passed (if applicable)
- [ ] Mobile responsive and touch-optimized
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Performance tested with realistic data
- [ ] Documentation updated

---

## Testing Strategy

### Import System Testing
- [ ] Test with 100, 1,000, and 10,000 row files
- [ ] Test with invalid data and edge cases
- [ ] Test rollback functionality with partial failures
- [ ] Test on slow internet connections

### Mobile Testing
- [ ] Test on various Android tablets (including older models)
- [ ] Test on different screen sizes (7", 10", 12")
- [ ] Test with different finger sizes and dexterity levels
- [ ] Field testing with actual foremen

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Load testing with maximum expected data
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring during imports
- [ ] Network performance on slow connections
- [ ] Battery usage testing on mobile devices

## Risk Management

### High Risk Items
1. **Mobile adoption**: If touch interface isn't polished, field workers won't use it
2. **Import reliability**: Data loss during imports would destroy user confidence
3. **Performance**: Poor performance with large datasets limits scalability

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **User testing**: Regular testing with actual field workers
2. **Incremental delivery**: Deploy polish improvements incrementally
3. **Monitoring**: Implement error tracking and performance monitoring

---

## Success Metrics

### Phase 3 Completion Criteria
- [ ] Import system handles 1,000+ components with <5% error rate
- [ ] Mobile interface scores >90% usability with field workers
- [ ] Dashboard loads in <2 seconds with 10,000 components
- [ ] Zero unhandled errors in production logs
- [ ] All core features work reliably on 3+ year old tablets

### Ready for Phase 4 When:
- All Phase 3 completion criteria met
- Audit trail system operational
- Performance optimized for production loads
- Field testing completed with positive feedback
