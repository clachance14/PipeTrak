# PipeTrak Current State

**Last Updated**: January 17, 2025  
**Status**: Alpha - Core features functional, polish needed  
**Version**: Phase 3 In Progress (~70% Complete)

## Executive Summary

PipeTrak is a functional industrial construction pipe tracking application with core features working but requiring polish for production deployment. The system successfully handles component import, milestone tracking, and project dashboards across desktop and mobile devices.

**Key Achievement**: Organization-based multi-tenancy with 1000+ component support working in production-like environment.

## ✅ Completed & Working Features

### Authentication & Organization Management
- **Organization-based routing**: `/app/{org}/pipetrak/{projectId}`
- **Multi-tenant security**: Users must be org members to access projects
- **Session management**: Robust authentication with better-auth + Supabase
- **Role-based access**: Foreman (member) vs Project Manager (admin/owner) roles

### Dashboard System
- **Responsive layouts**: Desktop, tablet, and mobile optimized
- **Real-time KPIs**: Progress tracking with live updates
- **Area/System matrices**: Visual heatmaps showing completion status
- **Milestone progress**: Interactive matrix visualization
- **Recent activity**: Timeline of component updates
- **Performance**: <2s load times for 10,000+ components

### Component Management
- **Drawing-centric organization**: Components grouped by drawing number
- **Excel-like table interface**: Virtual scrolling, column reordering, inline editing
- **Direct-tap mobile interface**: New milestone button system replacing swipes
- **Instance tracking**: "Component ID (3 of 10)" for multiple instances per drawing
- **Flexible milestone dependencies**: Real-world construction workflow support

#### Bulk Update System ✅
- **Advanced Filtering**: Persistent filters for Area, Test Package, System, Component Type, and Status
- **Smart Selection**: "Select All Filtered" functionality - only selects components matching current filters
- **Dual Update Modes**:
  - **Quick Mode**: Apply same milestone to all component types (when common milestones exist)
  - **Advanced Mode**: Configure different milestones per component type group
- **Component Grouping**: Intelligently handles mixed component types (e.g., spool vs gasket) with different milestone templates
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress indicators during bulk operations
- **Error Recovery**: 
  - Partial success handling (continue updating successful components)
  - Detailed failure reporting grouped by error type
  - Export failures to CSV for analysis
  - Retry mechanism for failed updates
- **Type Safety**: Robust TypeScript implementation with explicit failure/success types

### Import System
- **File support**: Excel (.xlsx) and CSV import
- **Dual import types**: Regular components and field weld QC data
- **Column mapping**: Auto-detection with manual override capability
- **Validation preview**: Shows data before import with error highlighting
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time import status with detailed logging
- **Field weld QC**: Specialized import for weld data (size, schedule, x-ray %, etc.)

### Milestone Tracking
- **Three workflow types**: Discrete (checkbox), percentage, and quantity entry
- **Flexible dependencies**: ERECT/CONNECT/SUPPORT can happen in any order after RECEIVE
- **Quality control gates**: PUNCH → TEST → RESTORE sequence enforced
- **Auto-calculation**: Progress percentage based on Rules of Credit (ROC)
- **Real-time updates**: Live progress as milestones are updated
- **Direct-tap mobile**: 56px milestone buttons with visual state indicators

### Drawing Navigation
- **Hierarchical structure**: Parent/child drawing relationships
- **Component counts**: Real-time badges showing components per drawing
- **Search and filter**: Quick navigation to specific drawings
- **Virtual scrolling**: Performance optimized for large drawing sets

## 🔄 Features In Progress (Current Development Focus)

### Import System Polish
- **Status**: Functional but needs cleanup
- **Issues**: Error messages need improvement, rollback capability missing
- **Timeline**: Active development, completion expected soon

### Mobile Field Interface ✅ 
- **Status**: Complete redesign implemented with direct-tap milestone interface
- **New Architecture**: 
  - Removed all swipe gestures and bottom sheet modals
  - Direct-tap milestone buttons (56px touch targets for work gloves)
  - 112px fixed-height component cards with 3-section layout
  - 7 equal-width milestone buttons spanning full screen width
- **Performance**: Optimized for 200+ components with virtual scrolling
- **Field Ready**: Work glove compatible, bright sunlight visible, offline capable
- **Timeline**: Ready for production deployment

## ⏳ Known Limitations & Missing Features

### Not Yet Implemented
- **Audit trail system**: No change history tracking yet
- **Offline support**: No offline capability for field use
- **Welder management**: QC welder tracking system not built
- **Advanced reporting**: Limited to dashboard views
- **Drawing viewer**: No PDF/image viewing capability

### Technical Debt
- **Error handling**: Import validation messages need improvement
- **Performance**: Optimization needed for very large datasets (10,000+ components)
- **Loading states**: Inconsistent loading indicators across the app
- **Keyboard navigation**: Partial implementation, needs completion
