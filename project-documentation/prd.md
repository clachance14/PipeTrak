# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Industrial Construction Pipe Tracking App ‚Äì MVP**
**Version:** 2.0 (Updated with Implementation Reality)
**Date:** August 7th 2024 (Project Start)
**Last Updated:** January 17, 2025
**Product Owner:** Cory LaChance
**Target Launch:** February 2025 (MVP)

---

## Executive Summary

The Industrial Construction Pipe Tracking App is a web-based application designed to replace Excel-based tracking systems for managing piping component installation in chemical plants and refineries.

The MVP focuses on two user roles:

* **Foremen** update installation progress in the field via mobile/tablet devices.
* **Project Managers** analyze progress through Excel-like reporting interfaces.

The system will track up to **1,000 components** across **100 drawings**, with all components using milestone-based workflows. The `workflow_type` field determines how milestones are updated (checkbox, percent entry, or quantity entry).

All table interfaces will maintain **Excel-like functionality** for familiarity and adoption in the construction environment.

Manhour tracking will be part of the eventual system but is **out of scope for the MVP**.

---

## Problem Statement

Industrial construction projects currently rely on Excel spreadsheets with pivot tables to track installation status. This creates:

* **Data Integrity Issues:** Multiple spreadsheets cause version control problems and inconsistencies.
* **Lack of Real-time Visibility:** PMs cannot see live field progress.
* **Inefficient Field Updates:** Foremen record on paper or offline, then re-enter into Excel.
* **Reporting Delays:** Pivot table reports are time-consuming and error-prone.
* **No Audit Trail:** No automatic record of who made what change and when.

---

## User Roles & Personas

### 1. Foreman (Field User)

* **Device:** Mobile/tablet
* **Location:** Field
* **Skill Level:** Familiar with Excel, basic mobile app use
* **Need:** Quick updates in the field
* **Frequency:** Multiple updates/day

### 2. Project Manager (Office User)

## Data Model & Workflow Types

All components use **milestone-based tracking** with Rules of Credit (ROC). The `workflow_type` column specifies the input style:

### `workflow_type` Values

1. **milestone\_discrete** ‚Äì Yes/No milestone completion (checkboxes)
2. **milestone\_partial** ‚Äì Percent entry for in-progress milestones
3. **milestone\_quantity** ‚Äì Quantity entry (e.g., feet installed) with system conversion to %

### Workflow Definitions

**Milestone ‚Äì Discrete (`milestone_discrete`)**

* Checkbox for each milestone
* Percent = sum of ROC weights for completed milestones
* Use: spools, supports, valves, gaskets, field welds, instruments

**Milestone ‚Äì Partial (`milestone_partial`)**

* Percent entered for milestones that can be partially done
* Percent = (entered % √ó milestone weight) + full weights for completed milestones
* Use: threaded pipe

**Milestone ‚Äì Quantity (`milestone_quantity`)**

* Quantity entered for milestone/component
* Percent = (quantity √∑ total) √ó milestone weight
* Use: piping by footage, insulation, paint

### Component Type to Workflow Mapping

| spool               | milestone\_discrete | Full                  | Per component             |
| piping (by footage) | milestone\_quantity | Full                  | Drawing-level             |
| support             | milestone\_discrete | Reduced               | Per component             |
| valve               | milestone\_discrete | Reduced               | Per component             |
| gasket              | milestone\_discrete | Reduced               | Per component             |
| threaded\_pipe      | milestone\_partial  | Reduced + Fabrication | Partial % entry           |
| field\_weld         | milestone\_discrete | Reduced               | Fit-up ready as "Receive" |
| insulation          | milestone\_quantity | Two-step              | Insulation & metal out    |
| instrument          | milestone\_discrete | Reduced               | Per component             |
| paint               | milestone\_quantity | Two-step              | Primer & finish coat      |
