# Welcome to supastarter storybook

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

## What's in this storybook

This storybook is a collection of UI components that are used in the supastarter app. It helps you to see how the components look like and how they behave in different states.

The components are built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Ark UI](https://ark-ui.com) (a headless component library). You can also add whatever component library you want to use.
