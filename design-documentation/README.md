# PipeTrak Design Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive UX/UI design specifications for PipeTrak's Milestone Update System, built on the Supastarter Next.js template with shadcn/ui components.

## Design Philosophy

PipeTrak prioritizes **field-speed efficiency** for industrial construction workers while maintaining the Excel-like density that office users expect. Our design approach:

- **Bold simplicity** with clear visual hierarchy
- **Touch-first interaction** for gloved hands (52px+ targets)  
- **Optimistic updates** with seamless error recovery
- **Excel-like patterns** familiar to construction professionals
- **WCAG AA compliance** with high contrast for outdoor visibility

## Key Features

### Three Workflow Types
- **MILESTONE_DISCRETE**: Checkbox interface for yes/no milestones
- **MILESTONE_PERCENTAGE**: Slider + input for percentage tracking
- **MILESTONE_QUANTITY**: Numeric input with unit validation

### Bulk Operations
- Multi-select with preview before applying changes
- Progress tracking with cancellation support
- Undo/rollback for failed operations
- Batch processing for large datasets

### Mobile Optimization
- 52px minimum touch targets for industrial gloves
- Bottom sheet patterns for milestone updates
- Swipe gestures for quick actions
- High contrast modes for outdoor visibility

### Real-time Features
- Optimistic updates with rollback on failure
- Live progress indicators across all views
- Real-time sync with conflict resolution

## Implementation Standards

All designs use:
- **shadcn/ui components** as the foundation
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with custom PipeTrak tokens
- **TanStack Table** for data grid functionality  
- **Next.js App Router** patterns throughout
- **Field-tested accessibility** meeting WCAG AA minimum

## Performance Targets

- Initial paint: < 1.5s for 10k virtualized rows
- Touch response: < 50ms for all field interactions
- Bulk operations: < 2s for 50 milestone updates
- Offline sync: < 5s when connection restored

## Getting Started

1. Start with [User Journeys](milestone-system/user-journeys.md) to understand core flows
2. Review [Component Specifications](milestone-system/component-specifications.md) for implementation details
3. Check [Mobile Interface](milestone-system/mobile-interface.md) for field-specific requirements
4. Refer to [Implementation Guide](milestone-system/implementation.md) for developer handoff
