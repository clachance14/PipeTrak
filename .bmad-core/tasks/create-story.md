# Create Story Task

## Purpose
Create a well-structured user story from requirements, ensuring all necessary information is captured for development.

## Prerequisites
- Clear understanding of user needs or requirements
- Access to story template
- Understanding of acceptance criteria format

## Steps

### 1. Gather Requirements
**elicit: true**
Ask the user:
- What is the main user need or problem this story addresses?
- Who is the primary user (role/persona)?
- What is the desired outcome or goal?
- Are there any specific constraints or requirements?
- What is the priority level?

### 2. Structure the Story
Using the story template:
- Write the story in "As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]" format
- Define clear acceptance criteria using Given/When/Then format
- Identify technical considerations
- Estimate effort/complexity

### 3. Validate Story
- Ensure story is testable
- Verify acceptance criteria are measurable
- Check that story provides value to users
- Confirm story is appropriately sized (not too large)

### 4. Create Story Document
Generate the story using the story template with all gathered information.

### 5. Review and Refine
**elicit: true**
Present the draft story to the user for:
- Content validation
- Requirement completeness
- Priority confirmation
- Any necessary adjustments

## Output
A complete story document ready for development planning and implementation.

## Dependencies
- story-tmpl.yaml (template)
- User input for requirements and validation
