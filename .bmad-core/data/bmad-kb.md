# BMad Method Knowledge Base

## Overview
The BMad Method is a structured approach to product development that emphasizes collaboration between specialized agents, quality processes, and systematic execution.

## Core Principles

### 1. Agent Specialization
Each agent has specific expertise and responsibilities:
- **Product Owner (Sarah)**: Requirements, priorities, quality assurance
- **Developer (James)**: Implementation, technical decisions, testing
- **Orchestrator**: Coordination, workflow management, agent switching

### 2. Process Adherence
- Follow defined workflows and templates
- Use checklists to ensure quality
- Document decisions and changes
- Maintain consistency across projects

### 3. Quality First
- All work follows definition of done criteria
- Comprehensive testing is required
- Code reviews are mandatory
- Documentation is kept current

### 4. Collaborative Decision Making
- Stakeholder input is gathered systematically
- Technical feasibility is confirmed before commitment
- User experience is validated throughout development
- Regular feedback loops are maintained

## Workflow Patterns

### Story Development Lifecycle
1. **Requirements Gathering** (PO)
2. **Story Creation** (PO) 
3. **Technical Planning** (Dev + PO)
4. **Implementation** (Dev)
5. **Testing & Validation** (Dev + PO)
6. **Review & Approval** (PO)
7. **Deployment** (Dev)

### Quality Gates
- **Story Ready**: All requirements clear, technical approach confirmed
- **Implementation Complete**: All tasks done, tests pass
- **Review Ready**: Code reviewed, documentation complete
- **Deployment Ready**: All quality checks passed

## Templates and Standards

### Documentation Standards
- Use consistent templates for all document types
- Include all required sections
- Keep documentation current with changes
- Link related documents appropriately

### Code Standards
- Follow project coding conventions
- Write comprehensive tests
- Include appropriate documentation
- Ensure accessibility compliance

### Process Standards
- Use checklists for all major activities
- Document all decisions and changes
- Regular stakeholder communication
- Systematic issue tracking and resolution

## Agent Interaction Patterns

### Collaboration Modes
- **Sequential**: Agents work in sequence on defined handoffs
- **Collaborative**: Agents work together on complex decisions
- **Parallel**: Agents work simultaneously on different aspects
- **Review**: One agent reviews another's work

### Communication Protocols
- Clear handoff procedures between agents
- Documented decision points
- Regular status updates
- Issue escalation procedures

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Requirements Ambiguity
- Use elicitation techniques to gather complete requirements
- Create prototypes or mockups for complex features
- Regular stakeholder review and validation
- Clear acceptance criteria definition

### Technical Complexity
- Break down complex stories into smaller tasks
- Identify and resolve dependencies early
- Regular technical review and validation
- Clear rollback procedures

### Quality Issues
- Comprehensive testing at all levels
- Regular code reviews and quality checks
- Systematic issue tracking and resolution
- Continuous process improvement

## Metrics and Success Criteria

### Process Metrics
- Story completion rate
- Defect rate
- Time to delivery
- Stakeholder satisfaction

### Quality Metrics
- Test coverage
- Code review completion
- Documentation completeness
- Accessibility compliance

### Collaboration Metrics
- Cross-agent communication effectiveness
- Decision cycle time
- Issue resolution time
- Knowledge sharing frequency

## Continuous Improvement

### Regular Reviews
- Process effectiveness assessment
- Tool and template updates
- Training and skill development
- Stakeholder feedback integration

### Adaptation
- Adjust processes based on project needs
- Update templates and standards
- Refine agent responsibilities
- Improve collaboration patterns
