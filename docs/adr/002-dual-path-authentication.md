# ADR-002: Dual-Path Authentication Configuration

**Date**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Authors**: PipeTrak Development Team  
**Reviewers**: Product Owner, Technical Lead  

## Summary

Implement environment-aware authentication configuration that enables relaxed settings for local development while maintaining strict security standards for production deployments on Vercel.

## Context

### Problem Statement

Authentication functionality works correctly in local development but fails on Vercel deployments due to:

1. **Environment Configuration Mismatch**: Different URL detection and environment variable handling between local and production
2. **Developer Productivity**: Strict production authentication settings slow down development iteration
3. **Security Requirements**: Production needs robust authentication with proper validation and security measures
4. **Deployment Complexity**: Single configuration doesn't suit both development and production needs

### Failed Solutions Attempted

Before implementing dual-path authentication, we attempted:

- **Single Production Configuration**: Made local development too cumbersome
- **Environment Variable Overrides**: Created inconsistent behavior and security gaps
- **Manual Configuration Switching**: Error-prone and required developer intervention

## Decision

Implement a **three-layer authentication configuration system** with environment-aware switching:

### Layer 1: Base Configuration
Shared settings across all environments (session duration, app name, core features)

### Layer 2: Environment-Specific Overrides
- **Development** (local): Relaxed security, debug features, bypass verification
- **Production** (Vercel/deployed): Strict security, required validation, no debug features

### Layer 3: Runtime Selection
Automatic environment detection with secure fallbacks to production settings

## Detailed Design

### Environment Detection
```typescript
// packages/utils/lib/environment.ts
export class EnvironmentDetector {
  static isLocalDev(): boolean {
    return process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && !process.env.VERCEL;
  }
  
  static isProduction(): boolean {
    return process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' || process.env.VERCEL_ENV === 'production';
  }
}
```

### Configuration Switching
```typescript
// packages/config/auth-config.ts
export function getAuthConfig(): AuthConfiguration {
  const envInfo = EnvironmentDetector.getEnvironmentInfo();
  
  switch (envInfo.name) {
    case 'local': return developmentAuthConfig;
    case 'production': 
    default: return productionAuthConfig; // Secure fallback
  }
}
```

### Security Boundaries

| Feature | Local Development | Production |
|---------|------------------|------------|
| Email Verification | Skipped | Required |
| Auth Secret | Fallback allowed | Required |
| CORS Origins | All (*) | Whitelist only |
| Debug Logging | Enabled | Disabled |
| Mock Users | Allowed | Blocked |
| Build Validation | Warnings only | Strict errors |

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **Environment Detection Utility** (`packages/utils/lib/environment.ts`)
   - Reliable environment classification
   - Validation at application startup
   - Caching for performance

2. **Three-Layer Config System** (`packages/config/auth-config.ts`)
   - Base + environment-specific overrides
   - Runtime configuration selection
   - Security validation

3. **Updated Auth Integration** (`packages/auth/auth.ts`)
   - Uses environment-aware configuration
   - Conditional feature enabling
   - Debug logging in development

4. **Safety Measures**
   - Build-time validation script
   - Visual development indicators
   - Debug endpoints (dev-only)
   - Monitoring hooks

### Development Features

- **Mock User Support**: Enable via `MOCK_USER` environment variable
- **Debug Endpoints**: `/api/debug/config` for configuration inspection
- **Visual Indicators**: On-screen environment status in development
- **Enhanced Logging**: Auth flow debugging in development mode

### Production Safety

- **Build-Time Validation**: Prevents dev variables in production builds
- **Secure Fallbacks**: Unknown environments default to production settings
- **Configuration Validation**: Runtime checks for required variables
- **Security Warnings**: Alerts for insecure configurations

## Benefits

### For Developers
- ✅ **Faster Iteration**: No auth friction in local development
- ✅ **Better Debugging**: Enhanced logging and debug endpoints
- ✅ **Clear Status**: Visual indicators show current environment
- ✅ **Mock Support**: Test without real authentication flows

### For Operations
- ✅ **Security**: Strict validation in production
- ✅ **Reliability**: Automatic fallbacks to secure settings
- ✅ **Visibility**: Clear logging of environment detection
- ✅ **Validation**: Build-time checks prevent configuration errors

### for Product
- ✅ **Reduced Risk**: Prevents dev settings reaching production
- ✅ **Faster Development**: Unblocked team productivity
- ✅ **Better Quality**: Proper testing in both environments
- ✅ **Industry Standards**: Follows established patterns

## Drawbacks and Mitigations

### Potential Issues

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Configuration Complexity** | Medium | Comprehensive documentation and debug endpoints |
| **Environment Detection Failure** | High | Secure fallback to production settings |
| **Developer Confusion** | Low | Visual indicators and clear logging |
| **Security Bypass Bugs** | High | Build-time validation and automated checks |

### Monitoring

1. **Build Validation**: Automated checks prevent insecure builds
2. **Runtime Logging**: Environment detection logged at startup
3. **Debug Endpoints**: Development-only configuration inspection
4. **Visual Feedback**: UI indicators for current environment

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Feature Flags (LaunchDarkly/Unleash)
- **Pros**: Granular control, runtime switching
- **Cons**: Additional service dependency, complexity, cost
- **Decision**: Too heavyweight for this specific need

### 2. Multiple Build Targets
- **Pros**: Clear separation, compile-time safety
- **Cons**: Build complexity, deployment overhead
- **Decision**: Runtime switching simpler and more flexible

### 3. Environment-Specific Config Files
- **Pros**: Familiar pattern, clear separation
- **Cons**: File management complexity, deployment issues
- **Decision**: Code-based configuration more maintainable

## Success Metrics
